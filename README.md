# CoreML_Starter

A starter project to get you going with an example of CoreML. I followed the tutorial [here](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/tutorial-on-using-core-ml-in-ios-with-vision-for-age-detection-f6e25c1d3e1f) with few corrections needed in the code and the AgeNet CoreML model was not available but found a copy (may not be) elsewhere. 

## Run
To run the code, after cloning, you should not need much on Xcode apart from pressing "Run"

## More
My Swift skills are not swift. This should get you started, the rest of this readme is irrelevant.

I am fascinated by the whole [Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Bayesian_networks) world really interests me. Mobile applications have been my focus since 2009. Computer vision and image recognition, I thought, would have come a much longer way by now.
